Where software deliverables are included as part of our work, we will strive to provide those deliverables with the following characteristics:
# Freely Available and Accessible
- Uses a permissive and open software license as opposed to a restrictive or closed-source license
- Published to an open location that is accessible from the commercial Internet without requirement for registration or other restrictions
# Uses Open Standards and Datasets
- For identity management, the deliverables use open standards such as Open ID Connect, OAuth2, and LTI
- For rostering, the deliverables use open data rostering standards such as IMS OneRoster
- For data interchange, the deliverables use open data exchange formats such as Ed-Fi and SIF
- If datasets are included as part of the deliverables, they should be released with a license that matches the rest of the code and included along with any source code or backed up in a well-documented, machine readable format
# Documented and Designed for Adoption and Re-use
- Documentation is co-located with the software deliverable and is written in a format that supports modification without special or proprietary software
- Guidelines for contribution are co-located with the software deliverable 
- Includes a Code of Conduct governing interaction between contributors with respect to the delivered code

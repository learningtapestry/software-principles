# About This Document
Learning Tapestry as an organization is committed to producing, leveraging, and supporting open standards, open protocols, and open source software wherever possible. This document defines the principles that we value in our work products and deliverables. We are indebted to the inspiration and language provided by the [18F Team's](https://18f.gsa.gov/) [Open Source Policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md), and to the [Open Source Policy Guidance](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/OSS/) provided by [cio.gov](https://www.cio.gov/) in the language and characteristics used below.
# Our Principles
Where software deliverables are included as part of our work, we will strive to provide those deliverables with the following characteristics:
## Freely Available and Accessible
- Uses a permissive and open software license as opposed to a restrictive or closed-source license
- Published to an open location that is accessible from the commercial Internet without requirement for registration or other restrictions
## Uses Open Standards and Datasets
- For identity management, the deliverables use open standards such as Open ID Connect, OAuth2, and LTI
- For rostering, the deliverables use open data rostering standards such as IMS OneRoster
- For data interchange, the deliverables use open data exchange formats such as Ed-Fi and SIF
- If datasets are included as part of the deliverables, they should be released with a license that matches the rest of the code and included along with any source code or backed up in a well-documented, machine readable format
- Where a technology or standard depends on a closed standard or proprietary technology, require that these dependencies be identified and approved before work is begun.
## Documented and Designed for Adoption and Re-use
- Documentation is co-located with the software deliverable and is written in a format that supports modification without special or proprietary software
- Guidelines for contribution are co-located with the software deliverable 
- Includes a Code of Conduct governing interaction between contributors with respect to the delivered code
